<!-- Hi! I am Shravan Nayak. I am pursuing my CS research masters at Mila and the University of Montreal under the guidance of Professor Aishwarya Agrawal. -->
Hi! I am Shravan Nayak. I am currently pursuing my research masters in computer science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Aishwara Agrawal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~agrawal/). At MILA, my focus lies in developing vision language systems that transcend linguistic barriers and cater to diverse demographics. Imagine a world where the language is no longer a barrier but a bridge, connecting people across cultures and backgrounds. This vision fuels my research and fuels my determination to create a more inclusive technological landscape for all.

Prior to starting my grad studies, I spent two years at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), contributing to the PowerPoint mobile team. I played a key role in crafting user experiences, developing features like background customization and text highlighting. If you've ever used PowerPoint on your mobile phones, chances are you've encountered my work, even if unknowingly!

Alongside, I've been deeply involved in artificial intelligence research for over four years. I have worked on reinforcement learning for energy mangement in microgrid networks at [IISc](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/), dubbing at [LT Lab in Hamburg](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html), and machine translation for low resource languages at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

In my free time, I love to cook and explore archaeology. Right now, I'm diving into the history of the Harappan civilization and hope to study the history of the entire world one day.
