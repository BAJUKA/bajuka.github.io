Montreal, a crossroads of cultures, offers a feast of authentic cuisines from around the globe. There's no shortage of amazing places to eat here! I've recently embarked on a culinary exploration of these diverse flavors and am using this page to track all my delicious discoveries. I am a vegetarian so there will be a vegetarian bias in this page. But my adventures often include various non-vegetarian options, courtesy of my omnivorous friends. This page will reflect a delightful mix of both, capturing the essence of Montreal's vibrant food scene from a veggie-centric perspective with a sprinkle of everything else.

## Kinton Ramen
This was my first time eating Ramen and it was amazing! The ambiance set the perfect mood, but it was the food that truly stole the show. We delved into both Shoyo Ramen and Miso Ramen, with the latter boasting a more robust and flavorful broth. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit here for both - people who love ramen and want to taste it for the first time.

## LOV - McGill
Pure luck led me to this gem of a vegetarian spot, after the caf√© I initially planned to visit was packed with a long wait. And what a delightful twist of fate it was! Finding a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Montreal is a rare treat, and this place was nothing short of splendid. The ambiance alone is worth a visit, but the food truly takes it to the next level. We indulged in the LOV Cheeseburger, California Bowl, and a Coconut Curry that exceeded all expectations (coming from a coconut aficionado), not to mention the Breaded Mushroom Burger. Each dish was a revelation, making this an unforgettable dining experience.
