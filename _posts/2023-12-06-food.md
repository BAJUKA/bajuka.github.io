Montreal, a crossroads of cultures, offers a feast of authentic cuisines from around the globe. There's no shortage of amazing places to eat here! I've recently embarked on a culinary exploration of these diverse flavors and am using this page to track all my delicious discoveries. I am a vegetarian so there will be a vegetarian bias in this page. But my adventures often include various non-vegetarian options, courtesy of my omnivorous friends. This page will reflect a delightful mix of both, capturing the essence of Montreal's vibrant food scene from a veggie-centric perspective with a sprinkle of everything else.

## Kinton Ramen
This was my first time eating Ramen and it was amazing! The ambiance set the perfect mood, but it was the food that truly stole the show. We delved into both Shoyo Ramen and Miso Ramen, with the latter boasting a more robust and flavorful broth. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit here for both - people who love ramen and want to taste it for the first time.

## LOV - McGill
Pure luck led me to this gem of a vegetarian spot, after the caf√© I initially planned to visit was packed with a long wait. And what a delightful twist of fate it was! Finding a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Montreal is a rare treat, and this place was nothing short of splendid. The ambiance alone is worth a visit, but the food truly takes it to the next level. We indulged in the LOV Cheeseburger, California Bowl, and a Coconut Curry that exceeded all expectations (coming from a coconut aficionado), not to mention the Breaded Mushroom Burger. Each dish was a revelation, making this an unforgettable dining experience.

## Bottega | pizzeria
I recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant, thanks to a dinner party with my lab team. The place, with its amazing ambiance, mainly serves up an array of pizzas and other specials that change daily. But that's not all - they also offer a scrumptious selection of vegetarian pizzas and pastas. In brief an Italian friend described this place as one of the best pizza places in Montreal so I guess no more comments are needed. I indulged in their Caprese pizza and it was absolutely amazing! The truffle pasta, though a special of the day and somewhat pricey, was soothing but didn't quite hit the mark for my spice-loving, flavor-seeking palate. And let's talk about the chocolate gelato - my first time trying it and it was easily one of the best I've ever had! Trust me, this place is a must-visit culinary gem in the city!

## Cafe Guerrero
This cafe has become a go-to spot for everyone at Mila, where my lab is located. They serve one of the most extraordinary vegetarian salads I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It's an array of ingredients: crisp lettuce, wholesome grains, a variety of dry fruits, juicy apples, rich feta cheese, and many other elements, all brought together with an incredible dressing oil that simply bursts with flavor. Not only is this salad an explosion of taste, but it's also surprisingly filling. It usually takes me two sittings to finish it, which is saying something. This bowl is a harmonious blend of healthiness and deliciousness, two qualities that you don't often find together. I have not eaten anything else here but judging from the line outside this place I feel everything is quite good.
