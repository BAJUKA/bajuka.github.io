When I was in India, there never came a time when I had to cook. At home it was mom and at work it was either
office food, swiggy/zomato or our house help. Also, good vegetarian food was always readily available and cheap.
But all that changed when I came to Canada. The food was expensive and vegetarian options very limited. I had to adapt.
Myself and the lives of my three roommates depended on it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

At first it was a bit daunting and confusing. There were too many things to manage: onions getting burnt, oil splattering everywhere. Plus I soon realised that my North Indian roomates could not take the heat.
So there was this balance of flavour I had to maintain. Oof! Thats a lot!

I started with the basics - cooking rice. It was not perfect but honest work. The sight of the final product very pleasing and satisfying. Below is the photo of the "first" rice!

    </div>

<div class="caption">
    Rice cooked for the first time :sob:.
</div>

And then it was time for the next essential food - the dreaded roti! It is dreaded because the whole process was so
tedious and the roti's I made - 12 of them - got eaten so fast :cry:

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Roti (soo gol) made from scratch :heart:.
</div>

Things continued and I stated cooking new things - rajma chawal, chole chawal, biryani, aloo palak, soya manchurian. Slowly I began enjoying cooking. A task which at one point was tedious and exhausting became pleasant and relaxing. It was like therapy amidst the academic and social pressure. I found peace in my thoughts and the comforting aromas around me.

Cooking has given me a sense of comfort that if AI takes over my job (I feel like that will soon happen), I can start food business in Montreal - a city with a lot of demand for vegetarian indian food :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:! Also, this has inculcated in me a deep sense of respect for my mom who used to cook for me :heart:

Let me not bore you with more details. In this post I will be adding the food I cook and a few moments we had along the way. I might group them and make this more interesting in the future.

It's almost the end of 2024, and it's been a while since I last updated this blog. Over time, my cooking skills have definitely improved. Cooking has evolved from just a necessity to something much deeperâ€”a kind of spiritual activity. It brings me peace, relaxation, and takes me away from my worries. These days, I find myself spending more time in the kitchen, and the results speak for themselves: the more time and love I put into it, the better the food turns out.

I did my best to do the same, but as you can see, mine didn't turn out quite as good, though it was still tasty. Iâ€™ll get there eventually! Need to see her cook a few more times ;)

    Dum Aloo! It took me an hour and a half to make this dish, but it was worth every minute. I watched a video that stressed the importance of cooking slowly on a low flame, letting all the flavors blend together. And let me tell you, this dish had everything blended so well! The gravy was a work of art! This was when I understood the magic of patience in cookingâ€”good things take time. And that is what I generally follow now.
