It involved way too much walking and climbing—two activities I wasn’t exactly a fan of. But then I moved to Montreal, went on my first “proper” hike at Gault, and realized… it wasn’t all bad. In fact, it was beautiful. Sure, the walking was tough (why does life always have to be uphill?), but the views were worth it. Since then, I’ve been trying to do more hikes. And now that I’ve done a few hikes, I decided it was time to write a blog about them.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that even though Gault was my first hike, Oka will be the first one I describe. Why? For starters, the whole experience was very memorable because I went there with some amazing people. It wasn’t just the trails or the scenery—it was the company and the stories we made along the way.</p>

<p>Speaking of stories, Karolina’s mom has been waiting for me to write this blog about our Oka hike. Every time I bring up writing, Karolina loves reminding me of her mom’s excitement. And honestly, you can’t let down someone that enthusiastic. So here it is—Oka gets to be the first hike I write about.</p>

<h3 id="oka-national-park">Oka National Park</h3>

<p>It had been a while since we had done something adventurous, so one day, Aayush and I decided to shake things up. We booked a car on a whim. If you don’t book things, they just don’t happen—at least that’s how all my trips are going right now. With the car set, we had a week to figure out where to go, what to do and who to drag along. We asked around, and Karolina, who had been part of our stargazing misadventures before (a story for another blog), was instantly in. Soon, Kanishk and Rishav also joined the team. We were now all set for a fun filled hike.</p>

<p>The morning of the hike was, let’s say, a little chaotic. Rishav showed up late… like, really late. And to make things worse, I added the wrong address to pick up Karolina, which caused even more delay. But somehow, after all the mishaps, we were finally on our way to Oka.</p>

<p>Before starting the hike, we decided to grab some food. There was this pizza place that claimed to be the best around, so we stopped there. Now, I was on a diet, so I ordered a salad. But I ended up eating some anyway—I couldn’t let it go to waste. Dieting can wait, wasting good pizza is just wrong.</p>

<p>So, after all the delays and eating, we finally started the hike. It was a very easy hike—honestly, I wouldn’t even call it a hike. It felt more like a walk through the woods, but a very pleasant one.</p>

<p>The trail eventually led to a viewpoint where there was a chapel, and along the way, we came across many small buildings containing the Stations of the Cross. “What is this?” you ask. Karolina, with her Christian education, took the lead in explaining the 14 images that tell the story of the Passion of Christ—starting with his condemnation by Pontius Pilate and ending with his burrial. We stopped at each station as Karolina shared the story behind it—how Jesus Christ, the son of God, was condemned to death, bore the cross, met his mother and the women of Jerusalem, was nailed to the cross, and finally died there. You can see in the pictures below how she was peeking into the chapel, trying to see the details, explaining everything to us, and, of course, clicking a photo for her mom ;)</p>

<p>We kept talking about religion and a few other related topics, and before we knew it, we reached the peak. The view from the top was pleasant. We took a moment to check out the last two chapels, enjoy  the view, and take a few photos. Honestly, the hike felt way too short—it barely took us an hour. So, we decided to keep going and explore the other trails before going to the beach.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, it was an amazing walk for the next 2 hours. We spoke about so many different things (without a single mention of AI—a big achievement in itself). Karolina shared her wild stories from China, including surviving a dog bite and getting stuck in quicksand. But the main topic of the walk turned out to be arranged marriage and how it works in India.</p>

<p>I explained the different types of arranged marriages, from the traditional “family-approved matches” to the more modern “semi-arranged” versions, where parents act like dating apps (think Hinge, but run by your mom and dad!). What really surprised me was how open Karolina was to the idea. I always thought people in the West assumed arranged marriages were “forced marriages.” But it turns out, that’s not the case at all. I suspect Indian Matchmaking and Seema Aunty have played a big role in establishing this perception. Almost everyone I’ve spoken to is her fan and seems to have gotten their understanding of arranged marriages from the show. It’s funny how a Netflix series can give arranged marriages such global fame.</p>

<p>We eventually wrapped up the hike and headed to the beach. Honestly, this is what makes Oka so special—a short hike paired with a relaxing time by the water. We spent the rest of the day swimming, splashing around, and just enjoying the calmness of the waves. It was so much fun, and I highly recommend visiting Oka if you’re looking for a mix of nature and relaxation.</p>

<p>After plenty of swimming, we saw someone eating ice cream, and of course, we had to get some too. The ice cream looked amazing and tasted even better.

<p>It started to rain after a while, so we decided to head back. As we were driving back to Montreal, I jokingly said, “The only thing that could make this trip more perfect is a rainbow.” And just like magic, there it was not one, but two rainbows in the sky. It felt like a heavenly sign, as if the chapels we visited had left us with a small blessing for our journey back. The trip ended on an equally amazing note with some delicious Indian food.</p>

At home it was mom and at work it was either
office food, swiggy/zomato or our house help. Also, good vegetarian food was always readily available and cheap.
But all that changed when I came to Canada. The food was expensive and vegetarian options very limited. I had to adapt.
Myself and the lives of my three roommates depended on it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.</p>

<p>At first it was a bit daunting and confusing. There were too many things to manage: onions getting burnt, oil splattering everywhere. Plus I soon realised that my North Indian roomates could not take the heat.
So there was this balance of flavour I had to maintain. Oof! Thats a lot!</p>

<p>I started with the basics - cooking rice. It was not perfect but honest work. The sight of the final product very pleasing and satisfying. Below is the photo of the “first” rice!</p>

<p>Things continued and I stated cooking new things - rajma chawal, chole chawal, biryani, aloo palak, soya manchurian. Slowly I began enjoying cooking. A task which at one point was tedious and exhausting became pleasant and relaxing. It was like therapy amidst the academic and social pressure. I found peace in my thoughts and the comforting aromas around me.</p>

<p>Cooking has given me a sense of comfort that if AI takes over my job (I feel like that will soon happen), I can start food business in Montreal - a city with a lot of demand for vegetarian indian food :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:! Also, this has inculcated in me a deep sense of respect for my mom who used to cook for me :heart:</p>

<p>Let me not bore you with more details. In this post I will be adding the food I cook and a few moments we had along the way. I might group them and make this more interesting in the future.</p>

</div>

<p>It’s almost the end of 2024, and it’s been a while since I last updated this blog. Over time, my cooking skills have definitely improved. Cooking has evolved from just a necessity to something much deeper—a kind of spiritual activity. It brings me peace, relaxation, and takes me away from my worries. These days, I find myself spending more time in the kitchen, and the results speak for themselves: the more time and love I put into it, the better the food turns out.</p>

We were all left licking our plates and fingers—yes, even Megh! 😄 She just threw in a bunch of random spices effortlessly, without even tasting it until the end. I did my best to do the same, but as you can see, mine didn't turn out quite as good, though it was still tasty. I’ll get there eventually! Need to see her cook a few more times ;)

    Dum Aloo! It took me an hour and a half to make this dish, but it was worth every minute. I watched a video that stressed the importance of cooking slowly on a low flame, letting all the flavors blend together. And let me tell you, this dish had everything blended so well! The gravy was a work of art! This was when I understood the magic of patience in cooking—good things take time. And that is what I generally follow now.

It could have been Aayush and Megh’s love and longing for driving, my own desire to learn to drive, or maybe just a need to explore more of Montreal. Whatever the reason, what started as a vague idea has become a wonderful habit—renting a car, heading out into the night, having dinner, and discovering new places. Though the reasons might be unclear, the joy of it is undeniable, and I hope it never stops.</p>

<p>So, here I am documenting these adventures for myself to revist and maybe for anyone else who might be curious. If you’re looking for beautiful spots to visit, these experiences might just be your guide. And even if they’re not, I want to remember each of these nights—the laughter, the long drives, and the beauty of places we never would have seen if we’d stayed home.</p>

<h1 id="beloeil">Beloeil</h1>

<p>The story  began one Sunday during my weekly visit to the temple. Aayush was with me that day, and we started talking about going on a drive and having dinner in a new far-away place—something we had wanted to do for a while but never found the time for. This time, though, we were both motivated and even Megh, despite his busy schedule, encouraged it. It helped that Aayush could book a car through Commune Auto (a car rental service) and was eager to drive.</p>

<p>We weren’t sure where to go at first, but I remembered visiting Beloeil recently for a lab retreat. It was just an hour from Montreal, and the beautiful pictures I had were enough to convince Aayush. After finishing our prayers, we hit the road. The drive was fun, and we talked about how we should do this more often. When we arrived, the lake greeted us, and we started looking for food. It was already 10, and everything was closing, but we managed to find some good pizza. We took it by the lake, eating and chatting about life. It was the perfect setting for it. My roomates started teaching me how to drive which was a bonus! The drive back was also wonderful. We decided that this will be a weekly thing and we will slowly invite guests if this continues ;)</p>

<p>With a memorable first trip, we were all set the next week for a new adventure. It was a Friday, and Megh insisted we go somewhere since he was eager to drive, plus he had just had his first day at the gym (dopamine boost!). Soon, a car was booked, and before we knew it, we were on our way. I hadn’t eaten anything that day, so we stopped briefly to grab some food—no one likes a grumpy Shravan on a car ride! Aayush recommended a nice lake/park about an hour from Montreal.</p>

<p>We reached there, unpacked our food, and started eating in the park. It was a beautiful night, with stars clearly visible. There were a few people sitting at a nearby table, and when we saw them heading to the lake (which we could only partially see), we decided to follow. It was incredible! I don’t think I can describe it in words, so here are a few pictures!</p>

<p>We later found out that the people there had come to see the aurora! We were thrilled—could our random trip lead us to something that amazing? Unfortunately, after waiting for a while, we didn’t get to see it. It would have been the cherry on top of an already beautiful night.</p>

<p>While exploring nearby areas as we waited, we noticed that every house had a light on near the entrance, each with an animal sitting there. Even the motel we went to for the washroom had only a cat at the reception desk and no human. Naturally, we came up with a theory: we had stumbled into a town where people turn into animals at night! Crazy, right? And no, we weren’t high. We’re just like this :). It was a wild hypothesis, supported by the “evidence” of an animal at every house. We discussed and debated with wild theories but eventually, we came to know that this was not the case - people can’t transform into animals :(. Still, it was a fun trip.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Adventures" /><category term="adventure," /><category term="fun" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Night-time adventures around Montreal]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First winter in Montreal</title><link href="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/winter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First winter in Montreal" /><published>2024-09-28T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-28T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/winter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/winter/"><![CDATA[<p>So, I had this idea to write a bunch of blogs about my first winter in Montreal, sharing all the snowy fun and chocolat chaud moments. But, as life often does, it got in the way, and I never got around to writing up my experience. Now, I’ve got a bunch of photos sitting around and not enough time to turn them into separate blog posts. So, I’m just going to throw all these winter pics into one place and share some stories as I go. Think of it as a quick winter recap, a “show-and-tell with lots of nostalgia.”</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> <em>Writing this blog at 2 a.m. brought a big smile to my face. Winter has been quite a ride. Lately, life felt a bit routine with all the work (not that I don’t enjoy it). But putting this post together made me realize how much more there is to it. There are so many little moments that might seem small at the time, but now, looking back, they don’t feel small at all. I’m really glad I made a habit of capturing these moments because now I can look back and see how amazing they were. There’s been so much to enjoy and remember. Plus, I feel really lucky to have met some great people along the way especially my roomates. It really does make a difference. It’s been a great winter, and I’m excited to revisit these memories whenever I need a boost.</em></p>

<p>When I decided to move to Canada, everyone I spoke to and every YouTube video I watched warned me about how tough the winter would be. They talked about -40 degree temperatures and how the sun sets at 4 p.m., making it feel like you’re stuck at home all day. It was a bit scary, to be honest. I’ve spent most of my life in coastal areas, where the cold never really bothered me, and now I was about to face a whole new level of winter. But, let’s be real, there wasn’t much choice in the matter. I’d made my decision to move, and I knew I’d have to deal with it sooner or later. So, here I was, getting ready for a winter that would be a real challenge!</p>

<p>I arrived in fall and trust me, it definitely helped. You ease into winter gradually instead of being thrown into it headfirst. I had a friend who arrived here during the last week of december and really struggled with the cold. Thankfully, that wasn’t my experience. The temperatures dropped slowly, and our regular late night walks built up a kind of resistance to the chill bit by bit. It was like my body was adjusting to the cold in manageable doses. It made the whole winter thing a lot more bearable!</p>

<p>Being from a coastal area, I had never actually seen snow before, so I was pretty excited. Time went by, and sometime during October I remember Megh telling me that there was a snow forecast. It was going to be Montreal’s first snowfall of the season, and everyone was very excited. Just look at the boys standing by the window waiting for it to happen!</p>

<p>Finally, at 4 a.m., it actually happened! We all gathered and rushed outside to see the snow. I know, after months of seeing snow, it might not seem like a big deal, but back then, it was incredibly exciting. Megh even called his girlfriend to share the moment (I am allowed to say this without getting into trouble 😉)</p>

<p>Fast forward a few days, and we had a Diwali party, which I’ve already covered in detail. The next few weeks weren’t as exciting though, with studies, assignments, and exams taking center stage. Exams here are quite different from what I was used to in India. For the course I was taking, we were allowed to bring a one-page cheat sheet. Naturally, I crammed an entire book onto mine! It’s hilarious to look back on now, and the funny part is, I don’t even think I needed it (yes, I’m smart 😉!).</p>

    The church where Paul almost converted us to Christanity! Luckily it was closed that day (phew!). On the right is the quite popular ice slide. Unfortunately there was not enough snow to ride it :(

<p>Overall, the trip was fantastic! It was Christmas, and the city had this wonderful festive vibe, complete with a Christmas market—my first time experiencing one. I’d definitely love to visit Quebec City again and maybe then I can write a seperate blog!!</p>

<p>Soon, it was Paul’s birthday. For those who don’t know Paul yet, let me introduce him: he’s the guy who drove us to Quebec City. Now that we’re acquainted, let’s dive into the birthday celebrations.</p>

<p>We spent Paul’s birthday at a casino—my first time ever stepping into one! I need to be careful at this place! Casinos can be thrilling in unexpected ways. We tried out a bunch of games and Aayush had some luck on the Wheel of Chance, hitting a jackpot of $50. But then, your boy (that’s me) convinced everyone to put a big chunk of money on roulette and lost it all in one go. Everyone thinks I might have a problem, but it was all part of the fun and excitement (believe me).</p>

<p>The rest of the time was a mix of studies and work, though I did manage some ice-skating. Most of it was dedicated to brainstorming and turning ideas into solid research. This is also one reason I couldn’t do more, but hey, I came here to study!</p>

<p>That’s all I could gather from my memory. It might seem like everything was nice and fun but that’s far from the truth. There were definitely dull and tough times, especially as I navigated some challenging emotions. I haven’t included those moments here because I want to revisit this page and remember the happy times. After all, we are in control of our happiness! So if you ever feel down during the winter, just know it will pass, and there will be plenty of fun ahead 😊 Hope you enjoyed the read!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Life" /><category term="first" /><category term="winter," /><category term="fun" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first not so icy cold winter]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It Does Not Take a Lot of Effort to Be Nice!</title><link href="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/gratitude/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="It Does Not Take a Lot of Effort to Be Nice!" /><published>2024-02-02T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-02T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/gratitude</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2024/gratitude/"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is going to be a short post as this was a thought that came to my mind which I felt like writing about.</em></p>

<p>Since arriving in Canada six months ago, I’ve experienced many new things and culture shocks. But, over the past few days, one thought keeps coming back to me: gratitude. This isn’t to say I wasn’t grateful before, but living here has changed my perspective in surprising ways. A quality I believed to be a silent companion of my journey, has unfolded its layers in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>For example, few days ago, holding the door open for someone at the metro station led to a simple ‘Merci’ from a stranger and an exchange of smiles. This nice feeling made me wonder, why did I do it? This and other small acts of kindness kept happening. The joy found in these interactions is undeniable, giving a sense of comfort and warmth.</p>

<p>Back where I come from, these small gestures aren’t as common. People seem too busy or maybe are too pre-occupied that they just don’t think about it. But here, I’ve learned that these small moments can actually be very powerful. When you do something nice and someone else does something nice in return, it makes you happy. This happiness creates a desire to continue being kind, which can have a positive effect on society. Maybe this is why such behaviour is ubiquitous here.</p>

<p>This also got me thinking why such acts of kindness seems more natural here than back home. Is the economic stability a factor?  Is it about having time and money to think about such things? I don’t think those are the reasons because being kind doesn’t take much of either. Maybe it’s something that has grown over time, becoming as integral to the community as the very air they breathe. We will never know.</p>

<p>This contemplation brings me back to my roots, where we greet others by saying ‘Namaste’ (I bow down before you). Coming from such a culture, how, when and why have we drifted from this ethos of reverence and kindness? But, more importantly, how can we bring this spirit of kindness back to our own communities? I believe the answer is to start practicing such gestures without the expectation of reciprocation, quietly leading by example.</p>

<p>Ah! I don’t know why I wrote this. I feel like I’m trying to capture something much bigger than I can fully explain. Perhaps, I should be focusing on my work instead, but I can’t shake the feeling that these thoughts about kindness and how we treat each other are important.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Opinion" /><category term="random," /><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Random thought]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Montreal Munch Map - A Vegetarian Journey</title><link href="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/food/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Montreal Munch Map - A Vegetarian Journey" /><published>2023-12-06T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-06T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/food</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/food/"><![CDATA[<p>Montreal, a crossroads of cultures, offers a feast of authentic cuisines from around the globe. There’s no shortage of amazing places to eat here! I’ve recently embarked on a culinary exploration of these diverse flavors and am using this page to track all my delicious discoveries. I am a vegetarian so there will be a vegetarian bias in this page. But my adventures often include various non-vegetarian options, courtesy of my omnivorous friends. This page will reflect a delightful mix of both, capturing the essence of Montreal’s vibrant food scene from a veggie-centric perspective with a sprinkle of everything else.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> After visiting a bunch of places, some of which I’ve written about in this blog, I’ve realized that a restaurant experience depends a lot on the people you go out with. I had a lot of fun at all these places not only because of the great food but also because of the amazing group of people I was with and the wonderful conversations we had while eating. So, make sure you have nice company, and you should have a nice experience at any of these places :)</p>

<h2 id="kinton-ramen">Kinton Ramen</h2>
<p>This was my first time eating Ramen and it was amazing! The ambiance set the perfect mood, but it was the food that truly stole the show. We delved into both Shoyo Ramen and Miso Ramen, with the latter boasting a more robust and flavorful broth. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit here for both - people who love ramen and want to taste it for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="lov---mcgill">LOV - McGill</h2>
<p>Pure luck led me to this gem of a vegetarian spot, after the café I initially planned to visit was packed with a long wait. And what a delightful twist of fate it was! Finding a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Montreal is a rare treat, and this place was nothing short of splendid. The ambiance alone is worth a visit, but the food truly takes it to the next level. We indulged in the LOV Cheeseburger, California Bowl, and a Coconut Curry that exceeded all expectations (coming from a coconut aficionado), not to mention the Breaded Mushroom Burger. Each dish was a revelation, making this an unforgettable dining experience.</p>

<h2 id="bottega--pizzeria">Bottega | pizzeria</h2>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant, thanks to a dinner party with my lab team. The place, with its amazing ambiance, mainly serves up an array of pizzas and other specials that change daily. But that’s not all - they also offer a scrumptious selection of vegetarian pizzas and pastas. In brief an Italian friend described this place as one of the best pizza places in Montreal so I guess no more comments are needed. I indulged in their Caprese pizza and it was absolutely amazing! The truffle pasta, though a special of the day and somewhat pricey, was soothing but didn’t quite hit the mark for my spice-loving, flavor-seeking palate. And let’s talk about the chocolate gelato - my first time trying it and it was easily one of the best I’ve ever had! Trust me, this place is a must-visit culinary gem in the city!</p>

<h2 id="cafe-guerrero">Cafe Guerrero</h2>
<p>This cafe has become a go-to spot for everyone at Mila, where my lab is located. They serve one of the most extraordinary vegetarian salads I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. It’s an array of ingredients: crisp lettuce, wholesome grains, a variety of dry fruits, juicy apples, rich feta cheese, and many other elements, all brought together with an incredible dressing oil that simply bursts with flavor. Not only is this salad an explosion of taste, but it’s also surprisingly filling. It usually takes me two sittings to finish it, which is saying something. This bowl is a harmonious blend of healthiness and deliciousness, two qualities that you don’t often find together. I have not eaten anything else here but judging from the line outside this place I feel everything is quite good.</p>

<h2 id="maison-indian-curry">Maison Indian Curry</h2>
<p>I’m generally not a big fan of Indian food in Montreal so this review is through the lens of Zewen, who was trying Indian cuisine for the first time. Our adventure at this Indian restaurant turned out to be quite the experience for Zewen. The Dosa was an instant hit with him, and in his own words, “Whenever I’m hungry, I’m going to order this now.” We also enjoyed paneer tikka masala and butter naan, which were quite tasty. Below, you can see just how excited Zewen was to dive into the meal. Overall, this restaurant is a great place to dine, offering a delightful experience for both newcomers to Indian cuisine.</p>

<h2 id="beijing">Beijing</h2>
<p>Located in the heart of downtown’s Chinatown, this restaurant is a gem for Chinese cuisine enthusiasts. As the name suggests, they specialize in Chinese dishes, with a focus on non-vegetarian dishes, but they also offer a variety of vegetarian options. I had the pleasure of trying their General Tau Tofu, which was delightful, accompanied by some steamed rice. The vegetarian menu includes other tempting dishes like fried rice, chow mein, and spring rolls, all of which I’m eager to try on future visits. Although I haven’t had much experience with authentic Chinese food, everything I tasted was incredibly satisfying. Hosted by my dad’s friends and their family, I got to see them thoroughly enjoy a wide array of non-vegetarian dishes. This place is definitely one of the top spots in Chinatown for a fantastic dining experience with great hosts.</p>

<p>Saaaaag is the word that comes to my mind when I think about this place. This Pakistani place has amazing, really amazing Sarson ka Saag (never thought I will hear this word in Montreal!). This is primarily a non-vegetarian restaurant which has small but really tasty vegetarian options. The food here costs very less and has great quality and hence, a goto place for us when we are craving for some desi food (Saaaaag XD).</p>

<p>Just go and eat here! I haven’t had much experience with authentic Mexican food, but everything I tasted was incredibly amazing. They have vegetarian versions of almost every item on the menu. The food is abunbant and filling for the price you pay (quite rare in Montreal till now!) and did I mention delicious (just look at the photos). Everything we tried was amazing but the burritos and fajitas were the best. Why are you still reading? Just go!</p>

<p>I mean, just look at the ramen! That image alone should be enough to motivate you to eat at this place. And it was delicious!! You can customize what and how you want your ramen. We ordered the all-vegetarian option with extra tofu and savored every last bit of it! This is a fantastic spot if you want to enjoy some delightful food and catch up with someone special!</p>

<h2 id="dosa-pointe">Dosa Pointe</h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most famous Indian restaurants in Montreal and for the right reasons. This place serves an impressive variety of dosas—there must be 20 to 30 options—along with a wide selection of North Indian dishes. It’s a fantastic spot for dosa lovers in Montreal.
As a South Indian, I can be quite critical of dosa places (and I was ranting a little :) ), but this one is really good. Although the style of dosas is North Indian, they taste great, are filling, and come at a very affordable price.</p>

<p>I treated my roommates here for a reason nobody else would, but that aside, the food was good. In the image, you can see the General Tso’s bowl with crispy cauliflower, which was delicious. In the background, there’s mac and cheese, which could have been better. This place is more known for its drinks, and my friends who had them found them delightful. So, next time you want to hang out with a bunch of people at a place with a great ambiance, good music, and relaxing vibes, do consider visiting this spot!</p>

<h2 id="boustan">Boustan</h2>
<p>I discovered this place for the first time during Ekta’s birthday. We roamed around a lot and realized that all the other places were closed (food places close really fast in Montreal). After walking for a while, we finally found this spot! It’s a chain that serves Lebanese food at an affordable price. We ordered the falafel bowl, which was very filling and quite good for the price. I’ve also tried the falafel roll here, which is great as well.</p>

<p>But the most amazing thing that happened was our encounter with the cashier! He realized that we were Indians (not that hard to guess!) and talked to us very nicely. It was the end of his shift, and he asked Ekta if she was Punjabi. And she is Punjabi (not very surprising, haha). He shared that he had recently had his heart broken by a Punjabi girl who cheated on him and hence had a distaste for them. The next hour was spent listening to an elaborate story from a stranger sharing very intimate details about his relationship with us and giving us free coke. Being the gossip person that I am, I enjoyed it! Overall, it was a weird and good experience.</p>

<p>Montreal has an amazing café culture. I discovered that there are many cafés where you can also work, and this is one such place. I’m thankful to Rabiul for suggesting it, as I find myself coming here again and again on weekends. They have one of the best hot chocolates I’ve ever had. The people are very nice, and it’s a warm, inviting place to tackle tough, cold problems. :)</p>

<p>This is a nice Greek place in Acadie, where we used to live. We stumbled upon it because all the other restaurants were closed. There are limited vegetarian options, and the Pita Souvlaki was one of the few available. The ingredients are all homemade, featuring incredible cheese, fresh vegetables, and an amazing tahini sauce that made for a refreshing and satisfying meal. Plus, it’s very affordable—you get a lot more than what you pay for! We also ordered fries and rice, which were good. Overall, this place offers healthy and refreshing food at a great price.</p>

<h2 id="sham">Sham</h2>
<p>This is a Syrian restaurant that exclusively serves plant-based vegan food—words that rarely co-occur! They offer an elaborate menu with a variety of items. Initially, terms like chicken and lamb confused me, but I later realized they referred to flavors that closely resemble those dishes while being entirely vegan. The food was good. We ordered the falafel salad and the shawarma plate, the latter of which was amazing. It’s similar to Beyond Meat but tastes much better. If you’re vegan, you’ll love the range of options this place provides.</p>

We all laughed it off initially. After all, we were newcomers in town, barely knowing anyone. Plus, organizing a party? That meant dipping into our already tight budgets and squeezing time out of our busy schedules. So, we just dropped the idea or so we thought.</p>

<p>As days passed, Megh’s idea, like a seed, began to sprout in our collective minds, gaining more traction (Megh’s birthday was on the same day). Before we knew it, we were caught up in a wave of excitement. The problem? We had absolutely no idea how to host a party, let alone whom to invite. But there was something infectious about our naive enthusiasm, and we found ourselves committed to making it happen.</p>

    Megh! in deep thoughts about life after knowing he was getting older
</div>

<p>The excitement about our Diwali party plan just kept growing. Eventually, all four of us got together in Aayush’s room to hash out the details. We were all in – this was really happening! When you’re a student, the first thing you think about for a party is how much it’s going to cost. This was our first big hurdle. We wanted our first Diwali party to be a bit fancy and memorable. At first, we dreamed big – imagining a wild, ‘Project X’ style blowout. But then we started adding up the expenses and our big dreams got a reality check.</p>

<p>After a lot of talking and a bit of arguing, we finally agreed on how much we could spend – which, to be honest, we ended up going way over – and what kind of party it would be. We decided on some tasty snacks like samosas and pani-puri, a variety of sweets, and drinks with a BYOB rule. We were ready to make this party one to remember.</p>

<p>With the party plan in place, we faced our next challenge: the invitation and guest list. This part had us scratching our heads – how many people should we invite? Would everyone we invite actually show up? Or, the scariest thought, what if nobody came? Amidst a mix of laughter and semi-serious debates, we took the plunge and compiled a list. We ambitiously settled on around 50 people (Yep, after everything about budget!). With the list ready, we crafted a fun invitation and sent it out to everyone. There was no turning back now. As soon as we hit ‘send,’ RSVPs started flooding in. This was really happening.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the day before the party, and guess what? We had done absolutely nothing. Nada. The living area, our designated party zone, was a disaster zone the night before. It was finally the day of the party when we realised “Kuch karna padega!” (We need to do something!). Suddenly, we transformed into a whirlwind of productivity. Aayush and I tackled the Herculean task of cleaning (God! We saw some scary stuff XD). Megh was on a mission to gather all the food and drinks. And Yash? Well, Yash was being Yash – my man bought shit load of nothing and spent all day doing so ! And then, as if by some miracle, by 7 pm, everything fell into place. The room looked great and the food and drinks were ready. Party time had officially arrived!</p>

<p>I vividly remember Le and Qian being the first to arrive, punctual as always. Meanwhile, I was still in the shower :sweat_smile:. As time ticked by, guests started trickling in, gradually filling up the space. What amazed us was the generosity of everyone – they didn’t come empty-handed. Drinks were the most popular offering (seriously, everyone brought drinks), but we also got a variety of fruits and food items. I was on a mission: introduce non-Indians to the wonders of pani puri and samosas. Watching their reactions was priceless – a mix of surprise, delight, and the occasional puzzled look.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this Megh decided that it would be a good idea to make pani puri shots. It was an abomination and blasphemy. This was the day, the holy pani-puri that has sustained us in times of both happiness and difficulty was desecrated. Please don’t try this. I intially spent a lot of time  explaining people what Diwali was but as the evening rolled on and more drinks were consumed, the significance of Diwali became less of a focal point. There were about 35 people who attended the party with some coming and going.</p>

<p>Finally it was 12 a.m and Megh’s birthday. It was the perfect climax to our first big bash in Canada. Not to toot our own horn, but I think the party was a hit! Eventually, it was time to bid farewell to our guests. With the last person out the door, we let out a collective sigh of relief. But then we saw it – the aftermath. Our house looked like it had weathered a storm. There was cleaning to be done, a lot of it. But in that moment, with the fun we had and my roommates a little too tipsy to care (Mom! If you are reading this I don’t drink), the mess didn’t seem to matter. We were just enjoying in the joy of the night and the sweet success of our Diwali celebration.</p>

<p>I’ve been living in Canada for the past two and a half months, and let me tell you, it’s been quite a journey! I’ve experienced a lot of changes in my life during this time, especially in terms of daily tasks like cooking, cleaning, and shopping. I know, I know! Some of you might be thinking that these seem like ordinary activities, but back in India, as a working professional in a metropolitan city, I never had to worry about them. Everything was taken care of so effortlessly and inexpensively.</p>

<p>I want to clarify that this blog isn’t about comparing my personal life in India with my new life in Canada, or debating which one is better. Instead, I’m here to share my cultural shocks experienced immediately after my arrival.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular belief that Canada boasts extremely developed infrastructure with huge buildings and advanced roads, I wasn’t particularly surprised by that aspect. Many big cities in India, except for perhaps South Bangalore :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:, match up in terms of development and sophistication. What truly caught me off guard were the ways people act and behave here. Below I highlight some instances.</p>

    Another ChatGPT illustration.

<p>Back in India, zebra crossings were more of a decorative feature on the roads, serving some vague purpose in the rulebook. Nobody really paid much attention to them. But let me tell you about an incident during my first week here in Canada that left me utterly baffled. I was out running errands, and as I approached a zebra crossing, a car slowly came to a halt. I was about to cross, but the driver, seeing me waiting, actually stopped and apologized! Yes, you read that right – he apologized! I was completely shocked. I mean, who does that? Why? These were some of the questions that I was thinking for quite some time.</p>

<p>In India, crossing roads was practically a battle, especially if you’ve ever been to Silk Board in South Bangalore during the morning rush :smile:. Even after two months, I still find myself taken aback every time someone prioritizes pedestrians. It’s a delightful surprise, one that I hadn’t anticipated before coming here!</p>

<p>I am not not wrtitng this to impress any Canadian authorities who will in the near future be processing my VISA applications :laughing:. You will generally hear the word “Merci” soo many times here! It’s fascinating how this simple French word has become a regular part of my vocabulary since my time in Canada. People here express gratitude for the tiniest gestures, no matter how busy they are. It’s a stark contrast to my experiences in India. I can’t recall anyone thanking me for such trivial things back home. Having lived in North India for a significant period, I’m well acquainted with the distinct language and tone of the people there (if you know, you know!). This cultural difference was initially quite surprising, but now, it has become a new normal for me.</p>

<h3 id="vegetarian-food-and-indian-food">Vegetarian food and Indian food</h3>
<p>I must admit, the availability of vegetarian options in Montreal has left me quite disappointed. It feels like most restaurants offer just one vegetarian dish on their menu, almost as a token gesture. Considering the growing vegan movement in the West, I had expected more variety.</p>

<p>What surprised me even more was the Indian food available here. It seems that Indian cuisine, prepared by Indians, doesn’t quite live up to expectations. The flavors have been toned down to cater to the Canadian palate. Canadians, like my roomates can’t handle spice which often results in dishes being overly sweet and compromises. In general, I have been disspointed by chaats, North Indian food and I dont even want to try South Indian out of fear of more dissapointment. On a side note, I simply fail to understand how panner costs more than chicken here! However, I recognize that it might be premature to form a final opinion, and I’m open to recommendations that might change my perspective. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to share!</p>

<p>Montreal continues to surprise me in unexpected ways, like the unwritten rules of standing on escalators. Standing on the wrong side often results in a chorus of “excusez-moi” from fellow commuters. Despite the initial challenges and surprises I’ve encountered during my time in Montreal, I am determined to stay open-minded and optimistic. I believe there’s a lot more to explore, both in terms of the city’s offerings and in finding the right balance between my expectations and reality. I’m hopeful that with time, I’ll discover hidden gems Montreal has to offer.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Opinion" /><category term="canada" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some things I found suprising in Canada.]]></summary></entry></feed>
