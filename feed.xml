There’s no shortage of amazing places to eat here! I’ve recently embarked on a culinary exploration of these diverse flavors and am using this page to track all my delicious discoveries. I am a vegetarian so there will be a vegetarian bias in this page. But my adventures often include various non-vegetarian options, courtesy of my omnivorous friends. This page will reflect a delightful mix of both, capturing the essence of Montreal’s vibrant food scene from a veggie-centric perspective with a sprinkle of everything else.</p>

<h2 id="kinton-ramen">Kinton Ramen</h2>
<p>This was my first time eating Ramen and it was amazing! The ambiance set the perfect mood, but it was the food that truly stole the show. We delved into both Shoyo Ramen and Miso Ramen, with the latter boasting a more robust and flavorful broth. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit here for both - people who love ramen and want to taste it for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="lov---mcgill">LOV - McGill</h2>
<p>Pure luck led me to this gem of a vegetarian spot, after the café I initially planned to visit was packed with a long wait. And what a delightful twist of fate it was! Finding a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Montreal is a rare treat, and this place was nothing short of splendid. The ambiance alone is worth a visit, but the food truly takes it to the next level. We indulged in the LOV Cheeseburger, California Bowl, and a Coconut Curry that exceeded all expectations (coming from a coconut aficionado), not to mention the Breaded Mushroom Burger. Each dish was a revelation, making this an unforgettable dining experience.</p>

<h2 id="bottega--pizzeria">Bottega | pizzeria</h2>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant, thanks to a dinner party with my lab team. The place, with its amazing ambiance, mainly serves up an array of pizzas and other specials that change daily. But that’s not all - they also offer a scrumptious selection of vegetarian pizzas and pastas. In brief an Italian friend described this place as one of the best pizza places in Montreal so I guess no more comments are needed. I indulged in their Caprese pizza and it was absolutely amazing! The truffle pasta, though a special of the day and somewhat pricey, was soothing but didn’t quite hit the mark for my spice-loving, flavor-seeking palate. And let’s talk about the chocolate gelato - my first time trying it and it was easily one of the best I’ve ever had! Trust me, this place is a must-visit culinary gem in the city!</p>

<h2 id="cafe-guerrero">Cafe Guerrero</h2>
<p>This cafe has become a go-to spot for everyone at Mila, where my lab is located. They serve one of the most extraordinary vegetarian salads I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. It’s an array of ingredients: crisp lettuce, wholesome grains, a variety of dry fruits, juicy apples, rich feta cheese, and many other elements, all brought together with an incredible dressing oil that simply bursts with flavor. Not only is this salad an explosion of taste, but it’s also surprisingly filling. It usually takes me two sittings to finish it, which is saying something. This bowl is a harmonious blend of healthiness and deliciousness, two qualities that you don’t often find together. I have not eaten anything else here but judging from the line outside this place I feel everything is quite good.</p>

<h2 id="maison-indian-curry">Maison Indian Curry</h2>
<p>I’m generally not a big fan of Indian food in Montreal so this review is through the lens of Zewen, who was trying Indian cuisine for the first time. Our adventure at this Indian restaurant turned out to be quite the experience for Zewen. The Dosa was an instant hit with him, and in his own words, “Whenever I’m hungry, I’m going to order this now.” We also enjoyed paneer tikka masala and butter naan, which were quite tasty. Below, you can see just how excited Zewen was to dive into the meal. Overall, this restaurant is a great place to dine, offering a delightful experience for both newcomers to Indian cuisine.</p>

<h2 id="beijing">Beijing</h2>
<p>Located in the heart of downtown’s Chinatown, this restaurant is a gem for Chinese cuisine enthusiasts. As the name suggests, they specialize in Chinese dishes, with a focus on non-vegetarian dishes, but they also offer a variety of vegetarian options. I had the pleasure of trying their General Tau Tofu, which was delightful, accompanied by some steamed rice. The vegetarian menu includes other tempting dishes like fried rice, chow mein, and spring rolls, all of which I’m eager to try on future visits. Although I haven’t had much experience with authentic Chinese food, everything I tasted was incredibly satisfying. Hosted by my dad’s friends and their family, I got to see them thoroughly enjoy a wide array of non-vegetarian dishes. This place is definitely one of the top spots in Chinatown for a fantastic dining experience with great hosts.</p>

<h2 id="786-restaurant-halal">786 Restaurant Halal</h2>
<p>Saaaaag is the word that comes to my mind when I think about this place. This Pakistani place has amazing, really amazing Sarson ka Saag (never thought I will hear this word in Montreal!). This is primarily a non-vegetarian restaurant which has small but really tasty vegetarian options. The food here costs very less and has great quality and hence, a goto place for us when we are craving for some desi food (Saaaaag XD).</p>

<p>Just go and eat here! I haven’t had much experience with authentic Mexican food, but everything I tasted was incredibly amazing. They have vegetarian versions of almost every item on the menu. The food is abunbant and filling for the price you pay (quite rare in Montreal till now!) and did I mention delicious (just look at the photos). Everything we tried was amazing but the burritos and fajitas were the best. Why are you still reading? Just go!</p>

We all laughed it off initially. After all, we were newcomers in town, barely knowing anyone. Plus, organizing a party? That meant dipping into our already tight budgets and squeezing time out of our busy schedules. So, we just dropped the idea or so we thought.</p>

<p>As days passed, Megh’s idea, like a seed, began to sprout in our collective minds, gaining more traction (Megh’s birthday was on the same day). Before we knew it, we were caught up in a wave of excitement. The problem? We had absolutely no idea how to host a party, let alone whom to invite. But there was something infectious about our naive enthusiasm, and we found ourselves committed to making it happen.</p>

    Megh! in deep thoughts about life after knowing he was getting older
</div>

<p>The excitement about our Diwali party plan just kept growing. Eventually, all four of us got together in Aayush’s room to hash out the details. We were all in – this was really happening! When you’re a student, the first thing you think about for a party is how much it’s going to cost. This was our first big hurdle. We wanted our first Diwali party to be a bit fancy and memorable. At first, we dreamed big – imagining a wild, ‘Project X’ style blowout. But then we started adding up the expenses and our big dreams got a reality check.</p>

<p>After a lot of talking and a bit of arguing, we finally agreed on how much we could spend – which, to be honest, we ended up going way over – and what kind of party it would be. We decided on some tasty snacks like samosas and pani-puri, a variety of sweets, and drinks with a BYOB rule. We were ready to make this party one to remember.</p>

<p>With the party plan in place, we faced our next challenge: the invitation and guest list. This part had us scratching our heads – how many people should we invite? Would everyone we invite actually show up? Or, the scariest thought, what if nobody came? Amidst a mix of laughter and semi-serious debates, we took the plunge and compiled a list. We ambitiously settled on around 50 people (Yep, after everything about budget!). With the list ready, we crafted a fun invitation and sent it out to everyone. There was no turning back now. As soon as we hit ‘send,’ RSVPs started flooding in. This was really happening.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the day before the party, and guess what? We had done absolutely nothing. Nada. The living area, our designated party zone, was a disaster zone the night before. It was finally the day of the party when we realised “Kuch karna padega!” (We need to do something!). Suddenly, we transformed into a whirlwind of productivity. Aayush and I tackled the Herculean task of cleaning (God! We saw some scary stuff XD). Megh was on a mission to gather all the food and drinks. And Yash? Well, Yash was being Yash – my man bought shit load of nothing and spent all day doing so ! And then, as if by some miracle, by 7 pm, everything fell into place. The room looked great and the food and drinks were ready. Party time had officially arrived!</p>

<p>I vividly remember Le and Qian being the first to arrive, punctual as always. Meanwhile, I was still in the shower :sweat_smile:. As time ticked by, guests started trickling in, gradually filling up the space. What amazed us was the generosity of everyone – they didn’t come empty-handed. Drinks were the most popular offering (seriously, everyone brought drinks), but we also got a variety of fruits and food items. I was on a mission: introduce non-Indians to the wonders of pani puri and samosas. Watching their reactions was priceless – a mix of surprise, delight, and the occasional puzzled look.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this Megh decided that it would be a good idea to make pani puri shots. It was an abomination and blasphemy. This was the day, the holy pani-puri that has sustained us in times of both happiness and difficulty was desecrated. Please don’t try this. I intially spent a lot of time  explaining people what Diwali was but as the evening rolled on and more drinks were consumed, the significance of Diwali became less of a focal point. There were about 35 people who attended the party with some coming and going.</p>

<p>Finally it was 12 a.m and Megh’s birthday. It was the perfect climax to our first big bash in Canada. Not to toot our own horn, but I think the party was a hit! Eventually, it was time to bid farewell to our guests. With the last person out the door, we let out a collective sigh of relief. But then we saw it – the aftermath. Our house looked like it had weathered a storm. There was cleaning to be done, a lot of it. But in that moment, with the fun we had and my roommates a little too tipsy to care (Mom! If you are reading this I don’t drink), the mess didn’t seem to matter. We were just enjoying in the joy of the night and the sweet success of our Diwali celebration.</p>

<p>I’ve been living in Canada for the past two and a half months, and let me tell you, it’s been quite a journey! I’ve experienced a lot of changes in my life during this time, especially in terms of daily tasks like cooking, cleaning, and shopping. I know, I know! Some of you might be thinking that these seem like ordinary activities, but back in India, as a working professional in a metropolitan city, I never had to worry about them. Everything was taken care of so effortlessly and inexpensively.</p>

<p>I want to clarify that this blog isn’t about comparing my personal life in India with my new life in Canada, or debating which one is better. Instead, I’m here to share my cultural shocks experienced immediately after my arrival.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular belief that Canada boasts extremely developed infrastructure with huge buildings and advanced roads, I wasn’t particularly surprised by that aspect. Many big cities in India, except for perhaps South Bangalore :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:, match up in terms of development and sophistication. What truly caught me off guard were the ways people act and behave here. Below I highlight some instances.</p>

    Another ChatGPT illustration.

<p>Back in India, zebra crossings were more of a decorative feature on the roads, serving some vague purpose in the rulebook. Nobody really paid much attention to them. But let me tell you about an incident during my first week here in Canada that left me utterly baffled. I was out running errands, and as I approached a zebra crossing, a car slowly came to a halt. I was about to cross, but the driver, seeing me waiting, actually stopped and apologized! Yes, you read that right – he apologized! I was completely shocked. I mean, who does that? Why? These were some of the questions that I was thinking for quite some time.</p>

<p>In India, crossing roads was practically a battle, especially if you’ve ever been to Silk Board in South Bangalore during the morning rush :smile:. Even after two months, I still find myself taken aback every time someone prioritizes pedestrians. It’s a delightful surprise, one that I hadn’t anticipated before coming here!</p>

<p>I am not not wrtitng this to impress any Canadian authorities who will in the near future be processing my VISA applications :laughing:. You will generally hear the word “Merci” soo many times here! It’s fascinating how this simple French word has become a regular part of my vocabulary since my time in Canada. People here express gratitude for the tiniest gestures, no matter how busy they are. It’s a stark contrast to my experiences in India. I can’t recall anyone thanking me for such trivial things back home. Having lived in North India for a significant period, I’m well acquainted with the distinct language and tone of the people there (if you know, you know!). This cultural difference was initially quite surprising, but now, it has become a new normal for me.</p>

<h3 id="vegetarian-food-and-indian-food">Vegetarian food and Indian food</h3>
<p>I must admit, the availability of vegetarian options in Montreal has left me quite disappointed. It feels like most restaurants offer just one vegetarian dish on their menu, almost as a token gesture. Considering the growing vegan movement in the West, I had expected more variety.</p>

<p>What surprised me even more was the Indian food available here. It seems that Indian cuisine, prepared by Indians, doesn’t quite live up to expectations. The flavors have been toned down to cater to the Canadian palate. Canadians, like my roomates can’t handle spice which often results in dishes being overly sweet and compromises. In general, I have been disspointed by chaats, North Indian food and I dont even want to try South Indian out of fear of more dissapointment. On a side note, I simply fail to understand how panner costs more than chicken here! However, I recognize that it might be premature to form a final opinion, and I’m open to recommendations that might change my perspective. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to share!</p>

<p>Montreal continues to surprise me in unexpected ways, like the unwritten rules of standing on escalators. Standing on the wrong side often results in a chorus of “excusez-moi” from fellow commuters. Despite the initial challenges and surprises I’ve encountered during my time in Montreal, I am determined to stay open-minded and optimistic. I believe there’s a lot more to explore, both in terms of the city’s offerings and in finding the right balance between my expectations and reality. I’m hopeful that with time, I’ll discover hidden gems Montreal has to offer.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="opinion" /><category term="canada" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some things I found suprising in Canada.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kitchen diary</title><link href="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/cooking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kitchen diary" /><published>2023-10-28T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-28T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/cooking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bajuka.github.io/blog/2023/cooking/"><![CDATA[<p>When I was in India, there never came a time when I had to cook. At home it was mom and at work it was either
office food, swiggy/zomato or our house help. Also, good vegetarian food was always readily available and cheap.
But all that changed when I came to Canada. The food was expensive and vegetarian options very limited. I had to adapt.
Myself and the lives of my three roommates depended on it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.</p>

<p>At first it was a bit daunting and confusing. There were too many things to manage: onions getting burnt, oil splattering everywhere. Plus I soon realised that my North Indian roomates could not take the heat.
So there was this balance of flavour I had to maintain. Oof! Thats a lot!</p>

<p>I started with the basics - cooking rice. It was not perfect but honest work. The sight of the final product very pleasing and satisfying. Below is the photo of the “first” rice!</p>

<p>Things continued and I stated cooking new things - rajma chawal, chole chawal, biryani, aloo palak, soya manchurian. Slowly I began enjoying cooking. A task which at one point was tedious and exhausting became pleasant and relaxing. It was like therapy amidst the academic and social pressure. I found peace in my thoughts and the comforting aromas around me.</p>

<p>Cooking has given me a sense of comfort that if AI takes over my job (I feel like that will soon happen), I can start food business in Montreal - a city with a lot of demand for vegetarian indian food :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:! Also, this has inculcated in me a deep sense of respect for my mom who used to cook for me :heart:</p>
